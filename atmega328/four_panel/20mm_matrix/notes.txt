Hardware modifications for 2nd verssion:

1.) Match resistor to LED matrix type so that we are sourcing from many pins
and sinking into one pin. 

2.) Change board-to-board communications to SPI. 

3.) Beef up board-to-board headers so that mechanical connection is better.
This will happen a bit by switching to SPI as we will require more pins.

lower profile.  wider


4.) Self identification - of position. No longer an issue w/ SPI instead of I2C as
this is done with the chip select line.

5.) Need new driver programmer PCB  - simpiler w/ SPI. 

6.) get dir of rx tx relace with chip select

7.) gnd on back of comm. header for gnd connection to gnd plane board on driver.
